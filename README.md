📌 Project Title: Task Tracker using React and Hooks
🛠️ Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js (Functional Components, Hooks)

Styling: CSS Modules / Custom CSS

State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)

Build Tool: Create React App

📄 Project Description:
The Task Tracker is a simple yet functional React-based application designed to help users manage daily tasks effectively. It allows users to add, view, delete, and toggle reminders for tasks. This project demonstrates proficiency in using React functional components and managing component state using React Hooks.

🔍 Key Features:
✅ Add new tasks with description and time

🗑️ Delete tasks individually

🔁 Toggle task reminder (like setting a flag/star on important tasks)

🕒 Conditional rendering for showing/hiding task forms

🔄 Persist data using local component state

⚛️ React & Hooks Concepts Applied:
useState:

Manages task list array, input field values, and UI toggles (e.g., form visibility).

useEffect:

Used for simulating lifecycle methods such as fetching initial tasks (could be extended to fetch from an API).

Component Composition:

Reusable components like TaskItem, AddTaskForm, and Header for clean structure and modularity.

Conditional Rendering:

Show form only when "Add Task" button is clicked.

Event Handling:

Handles user inputs like clicks and typing in a form to update task state.
